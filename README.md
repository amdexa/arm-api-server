This is an example accounts receivable management API built with Spring Boot 2. We started with reverse engineering a popular ARM application (using a swagger file available publicly) and we limited it only to  generate the application skelton and  we decided to continue with our own implementation, So no copyright infringement intended

* MySQL

## Prerequisites
